## Mutational antigenic profiling of broad sera (purified IgG) responses 

Adam S. Dingens, Jesse D. Bloom, in collaboration to Florian Klein's group

To view the data from XX using [`dms-view`](dms-view.github.io) you need three files: a [data file](process_BroadHumanSera.csv), a [protein structure file](5fyl_trimer_renumber.pdb), and a [metadata file](BroadHumanSera.md).

### files for [`dms-view`](dms-view.github.io)

- data file: [`process_BroadHumanSera.csv`](process_BroadHumanSera.csv), made by [`process_BroadHumanSera.py`](process_BroadHumanSera.py)
- protein structure file: [`5fyl_trimer_renumber.pdb`](5fyl_trimer_renumber.pdb). This is the [5fyl pdb file](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5FYL), with the antibody chains removed. The 321a insertion moved to 322a such that numbering matches the DMS data.  
- metadata file: [`BroadHumanSera.md`](BroadHumanSera.md)
