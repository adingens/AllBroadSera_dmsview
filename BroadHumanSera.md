# Mutational antigenic profiling of broad sera (purified IgG) responses 

Adam S. Dingens, Jesse D. Bloom, in collaboration to Florian Klein's group

# Brief description
We used mutational antigenic profiling with BG505.T332N libraries to map how all mutations to Env affect neutralization of purified IgG from numerous patients with broad serum responses.
